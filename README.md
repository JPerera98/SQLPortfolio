# SQLPortfolio
A place to show my skills for current and future employers

This Github was created to show the source code for various tutorials and courses ive been following in my free time. All of this code has been typed out only after it was fully explained and
understood unless mentioned eg: repetive data to be added into database.

In this code we used Postgres and Excel.

This tutorial was based on a youtube video by "Data with mo" where he shows how to setup and create various tables with primary and foreign keys, veiw specific infomation using WHERE, AND, OR
statements and manipulating/deleting and inserting data along with many other functions.

This is a work inprogress :)
